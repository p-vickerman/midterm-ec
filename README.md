Fork/Clone and submit by the end of the weekend for credit! 

* `twoSmallest`
  * Write a function called twoSmallest that takes in a single array of numbers as a parameter and returns the smallest two numbers in the following array format where the smallest number always comes before the 2nd smallest number (ie, the bigger number should come second): 
  * [smallestNumber, secondSmallestNumber]
  * If the array is shorter than length 2, return undefined to the user
  * You can assume that every number in the array will be unique
  * Do not use .sort()
